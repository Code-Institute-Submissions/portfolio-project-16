## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I simply want to get a feel for the food and vibe the restaurant stands for, and ultimatiely feel like trying out the food. 
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content. 
        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be aware of where I can find the restaurant and how I can get more info if needed. 

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have. However, this is not the type of website that one return to many times. The idea is to introduce the restaurant and that people come back to eat regularly.
       

    -   #### Frequent User Goals
        1. This is not the type of website you come back to frequently. Once you have found out about Tommy's Burritos you hopefully want to return to the actual restaurant frequently. People can also get updates from the Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. But the website is more a way for first time visitors to learn more.
       

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours are red and green, which belong to the Mexican Flag.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Arial font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Arial is a clean font which I really like, I felt that it was also suits the look of the page.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. I chose high quality pictures of Burritos, with the aim of making the visitor hungry.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about Tommy's Burritos.

        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. 
        3. The user has two options, click the call to action buttons or scroll down, both of which will lead to the same place, to learn more about the organisation.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
        2. At the bottom of the first 3 pages there are links to our social media pages, where users can follow us for updates.
        3. On the Contact Us Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.
